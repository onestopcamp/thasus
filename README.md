Thasus is a lambda function that checks whether a website is considered "fresh" and marks it to be updated if so. A website is deemed not fresh if it hasn't been scanned in the past 24 hours. 
Additionally, the website is hashed and if the hash does not match, it is marked to have its data extracted.
